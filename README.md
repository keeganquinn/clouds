cloudscontrol.us
================

cloudscontrol.us is a content-centric social art community, empowering you
to share text, photo, audio and video media. We enable collaboration on
digital art projects of any size or scale.

The site is implemented as a Ruby on Rails web application.

Production site: https://cloudscontrol.us

In November 2011, the code for the site was released on GitHub as open
source. It's not a particularly remarkable piece of code, but it might
serve as a reasonable reference point for Rails site development best
practices.
